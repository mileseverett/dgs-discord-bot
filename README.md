# DGS Discord Bot
A discord bot to serve all of DGS's needs. Created mostly by Miles with help from EB and currently maintained by Miles/EB.

## Functions

#### Public commands
- $vouchinfo: Shows the number of vouches for a specific person (when used in a non-whitelisted channel)
- $source: Gives the link to the GitHub page

#### Vouch/Anti-vouch commands (any Wing+)
- $vouch: Used to vouch a 2-stripe
- $antivouch: Used to anti-vouch a 2-stripe
- $vouchinfo: Shows all of the vouches and anti-vouches for a given 2-stripe, with reasons where applicable. This is the same as the public command, but gives more information in whitelisted channels.

## Contributing
If you want to help contribute you can clone the repo and make local changes. You can run the bot locally to test your changes (we have an existing discord server or you can make your own), and the bot runs off of AWS. If you need access to the "production" version contact Miles or EB.

To clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mileseverett/dgs-discord-bot.git
```

To run the bot locally for testing/developing just run bot.py. Code assuming the bot files are in your current directory:

```python
pip install discord
```

```bash
py bot.py
```

## Have ideas?
Send them to Miles/EB or post in the discord. Current possible future plans include automating DGS hiscores. Anything not DG related that would be nice?
